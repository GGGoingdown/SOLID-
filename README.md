# SOLID Example

### Single Responsibility Principle (單一責任):
> **A class should one and only one reason to change**
- [Example1](SingleResponsibility/srp_exp1.py)
  
---

### Open Closed Principle (開閉):
> **Software entities should  be open for extension, but closed for modification**
- [Example1](OpenClosed/ocp_exp1.py)
---

### Liskov Substitution Principle (Liskov代換):
> **The principle defines that objects of a superclass shall be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application**
- [Example1](LiskovSubstitution/lsp_exp1.py)


--- 
### Interface Segregation Principle (介面隔離):
> **No code should be forced to depend on methods it does not use**
- [Example1](InterfaceSegregation/isp_exp1.py)
---
### Dependency Inversion (依賴反轉):
> **High-level modules should not import anything from low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces)**
- [Example1](DependencyInversion/di_exp1.py)
